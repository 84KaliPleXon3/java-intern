### Getting help

The Intern team wants to help people like you write tests more quickly and easily than ever before. As such, we offer two different ways you can get help with Intern:

#### Community support

The Intern community is available to assist you with basic questions, advice, and general guidance. There are two primary ways to get community support:

-   Post on Stack Overflow using the tag [\[intern\]](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=intern). Please make sure to follow the [Stack Overflow guidelines](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) when asking your question in order to have the greatest chance of receiving a response!
-   Join us in [theintern/intern](https://gitter.im/theintern/intern) room on Gitter.
-   We also have an IRC room at [\#intern on Freenode](irc://irc.freenode.net/intern). Please make sure to follow the rules outlined in [How to Ask for Help on IRC](https://rurounijones.github.io/blog/2009/03/17/how-to-ask-for-help-on-irc/) when asking your question in order to have the greatest chance of receiving a response!

#### Commercial support

Some problems are too complicated, specific, time-sensitive, or confidential to be solved through free community support. In these cases, the creators of Intern, SitePen, offer [commercial support services](http://www.sitepen.com/support/index.html) for you or your company. Commercial support has several advantages over community support:

-   Guaranteed response
-   24 hours maximum response time
-   Priority bug fix and enhancement requests
-   Total confidentiality for your next big idea
-   Provides direct financial support for ongoing development of Intern

If you aren’t sure if commercial support is right for you, we’re happy to take a few minutes to talk through your needs in greater detail. [Get in touch](https://www.sitepen.com/site/contact.html) to schedule a time!

### Contributing

We’re always excited to receive contributions from the community. If you think you’ve discovered a bug, want to submit a patch, or would like to request a new feature, take a look at our [contribution guidelines on GitHub](https://github.com/theintern/intern/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn how you can contribute.
