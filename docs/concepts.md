# Concepts

## Unit tests

Unit tests test code directly. A unit test will instantiate an application class, or call an application function, and
make assertions about the result.

## Functional tests

Also known as WebDriver tests (after the [W3C standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/)), functional tests test code
indirectly. While a unit test calls application functions and examines return values, a functional test manipulates the
code in the same way a typical user might, by opening pages, clicking buttons, and filling in form fields.
